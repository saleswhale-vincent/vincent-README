## Hi, I'm Vincent

I'm looking forward to meeting you! Or I guess if we already met then I'm looking forward to knowing more about you. This document is a quick way to introduce myself and help you understand me better. This is definitely not meant as a replacement for us actually getting to know each other.

### My Job

1. I'm here to make sure you're both happy and successful. I'm here to help you improve your technical skills, grow your career, and enjoy your work while you're at Saleswhale.
2. I'm here to enable our team to produce amazing work. Specifically that means making sure all of us have everything we need to be productive as well as make sure we work together smoothly as a team.
3. I'm here to make sure our team is set up for success. Specifically that means making sure we as a team aren't overburdened and that we aren't taking on more than we can handle.
4. I'm here to make sure we're aligned with the other teams and that our team is getting what we need from them, and vice versa. Specifically that means making sure that we're working smoothly with the other teams here in Saleswhale.
5. I'm also here to code! We will see each other a lot in code reviews.

If at any time at all you feel like I'm not meeting any of these responsibilities, you'd be doing me a massive favor by letting me know as soon as possible.

Through the course of our working relationship we will have a lot of discussions around code. I will have thoughts on your code and I expect you to have thoughts on mine. Please don't think my opinion on anything is final. If you have a good reason for doing something and if we all agree that it's a good reason, then you should go ahead and do it. 

### Feedback

If you have any feedback, please don't hesitate at all to give it. Your feedback is critical to my success. There are three dimensions required for people to give feedback:

- Safety: People shouldn't be punished for giving feedback.
- Effort: It shouldn't be hard to give feedback. 
- Benefit: There should be positive results associated with giving feedback.

Let me know if I don't do well on any of these three dimensions.

You can also expect me to give you feedback from time to time. I don't believe in storing feedback so I will provide it as soon as possible. If you'd like specific feedback on something let me know!

### Want to talk?

If you have something you want to talk about let me know. I'm highly responsive to both Slack and face-to-face communication. If I have my headphones on, I would generally appreciate that you ping me on Slack first before coming to my desk, but if you don't that's also fine. 

I will always find time for you if you need to talk to me.

### One on Ones

How you want to conduct our 1:1s is entirely up to you. Over coffee (or beers), in a private meeting, walking outside, walking inside, let me know whatever works for you and we'll go with that. Initially we'll do 1 hour every two weeks and then adjust from there. If the circumstances won't allow us to meet then we'll figure out a way virtually to make it work.

1:1s are for you to talk about what matters to you.

### My Schedule

My core hours at the office are 9:30 - 6:30. You can Slack me 24 hours a day. I don't expect you to be responsive on Slack 24 hours a day. I will very rarely ping you outside of work hours for anything related to work. 

Sometimes I will work late, and sometimes I will come in on the weekends. This is my choice. I don't expect you or anyone at all to do the same.

If I'm on a holiday, I will be nigh impossible to contact. If you're on holiday, I also expect you to be nigh impossible to contact. Holidays mean no working. Though of course if something is genuinely on fire you can reach me through my emergency contact.

### My Interests

If you want to shoot the breeze and have no idea what to talk about, here are my interests:
- Food and food accessories. I like eating good food and drinks. If you have any recommendations, I would love to know. 
- Anime and everything in between. If you couldn't already tell from my desk, I like anime and otaku culture in general. If you are also a person of culture, we will be great friends.
